* About

This repository contains my [[https://github.com/mcraveiro/cunene/blob/master/cunene.org][personal Emacs configuration]]. It is heavily based on
others - copy and paste, mainly. It uses the literate config approach.

Note that this repository also includes all of the [[https://elpa.gnu.org/][elpa]] packages as per the last
time I've updated them. This means you get a fully repeatable config if you
clone the repo, but it also means the clone is very large. If you do not want
the elpa packages, you can simply create a blank =.emacs.d= directory in your
home and manually copy the two main files of the config into that directory.
These are:

- [[./init.el][init.el]]
- [[./cunene.org][cunene.org]]

Then restart Emacs, and it will download fresh copies of all packages.

* Trying it

You can test this init without changing your configuration:

#+begin_src sh
emacs --no-init-file -l ./init.el
#+end_src
