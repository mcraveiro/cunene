;;; Commentary: 
;; 
;; Currently it only adds some faces to the customize group font-lock-faces. The
;; plan is however that it will provide additional font lock keyword forms. As
;; font-lock.el states in it's commentary section, at least it's syntactic parse
;; abilities could be improved.
;;
;;; Code: 

(require 'font-lock)

(defface font-lock-unimportant
  '((((background dark)) (:foreground "gray80"))
    (t (:foreground "gray80")))
  "Face for hi-lock mode."
  :group 'font-lock-faces)

(defface font-lock-semi-unimportant
  '((((background dark)) (:foreground "gray80"))
    (t (:foreground "gray80")))
  "Face for hi-lock mode."
  :group 'font-lock-faces)

(defface font-lock-type-def
  '((((background dark)) (:foreground "green"))
    (t (:foreground "green")))
  "Face for hi-lock mode."
  :group 'font-lock-faces)

(defface font-lock-jump-keyword
  '((t nil))
  "Face for hi-lock mode."
  :group 'font-lock-faces)

;; font-lock.el says (see definition of the variable font-lock-comment-face)
;; that there is actually no need to create variables that specify face names.
;; However it seems to be needed all the same.
(defvar font-lock-semi-unimportant 'font-lock-semi-unimportant)
